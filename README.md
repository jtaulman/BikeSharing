## Summary

When looking through all the data the best time for the bikes to be available would be during the morning and afternoon, before and after work. Thinking about this business in De Moines, is hard because there are not as many cars on the island of Manhattan. Everything is much closer so biking is easy.

### Additional Data

1. Bike usage based on weather since Iowa gets very cold and snowy during the winter.
2. Usage data for each month instead of just August.
